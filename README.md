This is (will be) a very basic, but simultaniously realistic long range shooting simulator. I will leave it at that for now. More documentation will come as updates are pushed!

As of today the target distance can be updated live using the "-" and "+" keys. each click will decrease and increase target distance by 100 meters, respectively. The next goal is to use the space bar to "fire" the gun and paint the bullet hole on the target.

Today I have implemented a distance tag and a 3 second hit miss message in the top corners of the screen. All that I need to do for this to be quote on quote "finished" is to add the proper trajectory physics and polish it up. At that point it would be considered an MVP and I could work on making it look pretty.
