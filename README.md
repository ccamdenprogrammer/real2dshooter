This is (will be) a very basic, but simultaniously realistic long range shooting simulator. I will leave it at that for now. More documentation will come as updates are pushed!

As of today the target distance can be updated live using the "-" and "+" keys. each click will decrease and increase target distance by 100 meters, respectively. The next goal is to use the space bar to "fire" the gun and paint the bullet hole on the target.

Today I have implemented a distance tag and a 3 second hit miss message in the top corners of the screen. All that I need to do for this to be quote on quote "finished" is to add the proper trajectory physics and polish it up. At that point it would be considered an MVP and I could work on making it look pretty.

It's been awhile since I've stabbed at this project, but today I used Chat GPT to add the basis for a flight path visualization box in the top right corner. Right now, it just shows a stright line, which isnt really realistic, so I'm going to work on making it a proper arc. Also, using the up and down arrow keys, you can now adjust the shooting angle by 0.1ยบ with each click! This needs a lot of polishing and I'm not quite sure of the physics are neccessarily realistic; but I will do the nitty gritty later on. For now I need to finish adding all the functionality. I'm almost done! The only things I still want to add are a gun image on screen so that it looks like an actual shooting range and then I want to make it so that the bullet hole and the hit/miss message doesn't appear until the realistic amount of time has passed.
